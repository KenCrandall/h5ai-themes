# h5ai Themes

These icon themes were previously shipped with [h5ai](https://github.com/lrsjng/h5ai).
Put these theme folders into folder `_h5ai/client/themes` of your h5ai installation,
so that the file structure will be `_h5ai/client/themes/<theme-name>/icons/<type>.<ext>`.

To select a theme use the option `view > theme` in file `_h5ai/conf/options.json`.
