# h5ai Themes

These icon themes were previously shipped with [h5ai](https://github.com/lrsjng/h5ai).
Put these theme folders into folder `_h5ai/client/themes` of your h5ai installation,
so that the file structure will be `_h5ai/client/themes/<theme-name>/icons/<type>.<ext>`.

To select a theme use the option `view > theme` in file `_h5ai/conf/options.json`.

Currently there are two themes included:

* `evolvere` based on [Evolvere Icon Theme](http://franksouza183.deviantart.com/art/Evolvere-Icon-theme-440718295)&nbsp;(CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)
* `faenza` based on [Faenza Icons](http://tiheum.deviantart.com/art/Faenza-Icons-173323228)&nbsp;(GPL)
